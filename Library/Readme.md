## Submodule Library
The most important OSM-Tags are defined as Enum-values. The supported keys reside in the Enum 
`de.gaiasoft.osm.taglib.def.Key`

For each supported key with name *KEYNAME*, which has well know values, there is a Enum
`de.gaiasoft.osm.taglib.def.Value_KEYNAME`

The enums in the are generated by the module 'Generator' from data of the OpenStreetMap project. 
The values of the enums are is made available under the Open Database License:   
http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/.


### ToDos + improvements
* Create KeyUnknown-Exception and throw it in TagHandler-functions working on a key (except findKey() )   
* Concept for keys having known as well as free values in combination (-> work in generator)
