#OsmTagLib

The most important OSM-Tags are defined as Enum-values. The supported keys reside in the Enum 
`de.gaiasoft.osm.taglib.def.Key`

For each supported key with name *KEYNAME*, which has well know values, there is a Enum
`de.gaiasoft.osm.taglib.def.Value_KEYNAME`

The enums in the are generated by the TagLibGenerator.

        // TODO: Maybe an exception should be thrown, if key is not supported.
